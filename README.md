Here is my proposition of code for the Philosophers project at 42. This project helped me develop a deep understanding of thread management, synchronization, and concurrency in C using POSIX threads. I implemented robust mechanisms to avoid deadlocks, data races, and starvation issues, while keeping the logic clear and maintainable.

Through this challenge, I also gained practical experience in handling mutexes, managing shared resources, and designing thread-safe access to critical data. This project is a great opportunity to push further by experimenting with semaphores, real-time monitoring, or visualizations of concurrent behaviors.
